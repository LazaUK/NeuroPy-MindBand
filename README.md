# NeuroPy-MindBand

Original code cloned from https://github.com/dweidai/NeuroPy-Python3.0 and then adapted to work with Sichiray Mindband headset. The library itself was written originally by Sahil Singh in Python 2.x (https://pypi.org/project/NeuroPy/) to connect and interact with Neurosky's MindWave EEG headset.

Sichiray's MindBand uses the chipset from the same vendor, so it's almost fully compatible with NeuroSky-specific code.
